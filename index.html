                            Tuksu-Man was the first of the two projects. The client wanted a classic design where their mascor, Tuksu, would be incorporated as the main character and the rest of the game would be themed in their field of duty, forest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After doing some brain storming with the client, we ended up in a reproduction of a PacMan game, where Tuksu would serve as Pac, the level would be a forest and the enemies would be the filth that if left into the forests by humans.

                        <p>
                            As in the beginning of the project it was agreed, we started making a second game for them since the first was ready in time. This time the client wished for something more original and something that would use the touchscreen of the tablets to higher
                            degree. Also they wished to somehow use biodiesel as the theme.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Again, after brain storming whit the client, we came up with a biodiesel "production" game. The player would cut pieces out of a biomass and that mass would be converted into biodiesel that could be used to drive to the next level of the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For me, this was the first contact to actually manipulating 3D models. The cutting was archieved using a single circle plane. When the player drags a finger across the mass, the trajectory is recorded and the mesh is reconstructed to exclude the the smaller
                            piece.

                    <p>I worked at Kyy Games for a single summer as an intern. The internship was unpaid and needed to complete my studies, but it provided me with the first inside view to a actual game studio working on actual project of their own and those

                            release it. To my knowledge, the game will be released in most popular app stores close to the change of the year.
