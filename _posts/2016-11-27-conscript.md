# Conscript time

I started my conscript duty in Kajaani to be trained into a signaller. During this time I applied to be assigned into a special tasks force as an ADL-developer. The good news I got a few days before my transfer and I was moved to Santahamina after the basic training.

I was assigned to serve as an ADL-Developer in Media- and Picture services unit in Tuusula under Major Tihula. I worked in a team of four and we started designing our project.

The previous team had made some designs of educational mobile games and had made a presentation of the project to headquarters that approved continuing it. So our team's assignment was to design and implement a game that could be used in tandem with the classroom activities during basic training, and possibly in the future even substitute some parts of it.

Our team got a pretty free hand on the design and making of the game. We brainstormed some ideas, got feedback from the Major and decided to start making a sight adjusting game. The main focus was to make a premise, where the player would be able to practice and understand how the sights work in the weapon used by the Finnish military.

The frame was pretty simple; provide a shooting range and a scene to adjust the sights. I worked as the main developer on the project and our team had a modeler and one person focused on the menus of the game. We worked on the project for approximately five months and left it a touch away from release. The next team would make a bit of polishing into the game and the last I heard, the release was scheduled for the end of 2016. I'll be updating more info in here once the game has been published.
