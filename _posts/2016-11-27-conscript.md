I started my conscript duty in Kajaani to be trained into a signaller. During this time I applied to be assigned into a special tasks force as a ADL-dveloper. The good news I got few days before my transfer and I was moved to Santahamina after the basic training.

I was assigned to serve as a ADL-Developer in Media- and Pictureservices unit in Tuusula under Major Tihula. I worked in a team of four and we started designing our project.

The previous team had made some designs of educational mobile games and had made a presentation of the project to headquarters that approved continuing it. So our teams assignment was to design and implement a game that could be used in tandem with the class room activities during basic training, and possibly in the future even substitute some parts of it.

Our team got a pretty free hand on the design and making of the game. We brainstormed some ideas, got feedback from the Major and decided to start making a sight adjusting game. The main focus was to make a premise, where the player would be able to practice and understand how the sights work in the weapon used by Finnish military.

The frame was pretty simple; provide a shooting range and a scene to adjust the sights. I worked as the main developer in the project and our team had a modeler and one person focused on the menus of the game. We worked on the project for approximately five months and left it a touch away from release. The next team would make a bit of polishing into the game and on last note, the release was scheduled for the end of 2016. I'll be updating more info in here once the game has been published.
