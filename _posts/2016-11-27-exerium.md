# Current situation

Exerium is my current employer. I am working as a part-time developer on a Unity SDK project for their new software addition to the GameXR product.

I am working using Unity3D and attacking it with native projects in multiple platforms. Unity side of the work relates heavily on tilt and angle calculation, whereas the native side includes bluetooth, native UIs and and external devices.

This also includes building the Unity and Visual Studio projects, managing them, handling their version control, documentation, wiki and issue handling. I am basically in charge of the on client implementation and management of the current development. Being a part-time worked might seem a little odd for such a task, but the situation is what it is.
