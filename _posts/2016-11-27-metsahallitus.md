# TL;DR

I worked with Pilke for three months, during which I developer two games with my team mate and published them to the iOS App Store. Both of the games are still there; 'Tuksu-man' and 'BioCruising'.

# Science center Pilke, Mets채hallitus

Pilke is a science center in Rovaniemi and it is owned by the Finnish Mets채hallitus. is a Finnish state enterprise that administers the state owned land and ware areas.

I approached Pilke after I heard that they needed some mobile game content for their 'Mets채luola' fair setup. They have multiple iPads in stands inside their setup, but needed tailored content for them that would appeal to young children. I assembled a team, talked with my teachers about getting school credit and set up a meeting. The goal was to make two published iPad games for the stand during a single summer vacation.

# Tuksu-man

This was the first of the two projects. The client wanted a classic design where their mascor, Tuksu, would be incorporated as the main character and the rest of the game would be themed in their field of duty, forest.

After doing some brain storming with the client, we ended up in a reproduction of a PacMan game, where Tuksu would serve as Pac, the level would be a forest and the enemies would be the filth that if left into the forests by humans.

# BioCruising

As in the beginning of the project it was agreed, we started making a second game for them since the first was ready in time. This time the client wished for something more original and something that would use the touchscreen of the tablets to higher degree. Also they wished to somehow use biodiesel as the theme.

Again, after brain storming whit the client, we came up with a biodiesel "production" game. The player would cut pieces out of a biomass and that mass would be converted into biodiesel that could be used to drive to the next level of the game.

For me, this was the first contact to actually manipulating 3D models. The cutting was archieved using a single circle plane. When the player drags a finger across the mass, the trajectory is recorded and the mesh is reconstructed to exclude the the smaller piece.
