# TL;DR

I graduated as a Bachelor of Information Technology in the and of 2015, worked on two iOS projects for science center Pilke, as an intern for Kyy Games and my thesis work was titled 'Interaction in Games from the Developer's Viewpoint'.

I gained strong and versatile programming skills from my studypath in Software development, but used most of my free choice to gear towards the game development aspects of programming.

# The long version

I graduated from Tampere university of Applied Sciences, TAMK, as a Bachelor of Information Technology in the end of 2015.

From the beginning of my studies, my main focus was on gathering as much knowledge and experience on programming, so I chose software development as my study path. This proved to be a perfect choice for me, as TAMK proved to have an excelled instructors when it came to programming. Here I got my first real taste into professional grade programming and got a really good basis for my understanding of Object Oriented Programming, different programming patterns and multiple language syntaxes. Funny thing was, that our teacher was using the same courses for us, that he was using when he held evening courses for some of the most acknowledged programming houses in the Tampere area.

At the time of choosing my study path, I was perplexed on whether to choose Game Development or Software development. I chose software to get priority on some of the core programming courses in the path, but still wanted to do game development. For that, I made most of my project assignment in my courses into games or something closely resembling them. This is also the time when I started using Unity on almost daily basis during my freetime.

## Experience

On the job learning was part of the studies. I completed mine in two periods. During the first one I worked on a projects for science center Pilke in Rovaniemie and the second period I worked at Kyy Games as an intern. You can find more detailed info on these on the other posts in this site, so I'll just do a small recap.

For Pilke, I worked on two iOS games. They have this 'Mets√§luola'-named fair stand that is meant for parent to bring their kids in during the forestation event to enjoy themselves and at the same time learn something about the business and forests in general. These two games are 'Tuksu-Man' and 'Bio-Cruising' and are both running to date in the fair stand. Both were published at the Apples App Store and are free to download.

At Kyy Games I worked as a intern. At first I was assigned to a rework of a older projects that didn't quite catch the wind in it wings, but got assigned to many other projects during my stay as the original project was left waiting for an artist. It was a shame that I could't continue working for them after the intern period, but the company was going through some changes and didn't have the capasity to hire a new developer.

## Thesis work

For my thesis work I made a project for my current employer, Exerium. The project was a simple tablet game where the player was supposed to aim at targets and hold over them to shoot. The unique piece was the controller and the actual use of the game. The game used the companys GameXR gaming chair as the controller. The player would tilt the chair to move the crosshair and the game would 'guide' the player to make moves that would be beneficial for the players health. This was the main focus, as the game was going to be testes as tool to help in rehabilitation of spine trauma and other problems. Again, more on this project in the project posts.

My actual paper was titled 'Interaction in Games from the Developer's Viewpoint'. The aim was to observe the impact of the interaction on programming and the effect of programming decisions on the interaction between the game and the player. For me, the most intresting find was the fact, that there is not much information on really good examples of games using accelerometer or any kind of tilt for the movement in mobile games. There is some excecutions, but most of them are crude skeletons of what they could be. This leads to bad gameplay experience, as the movement is not exactly what the player expects.
