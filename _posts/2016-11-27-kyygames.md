# Kyy games

This was a intern position during my studies and lasted for a few months. I didn't get an actual job out of it, which is a shame, because the company was going though some changes and didn't have the capacity to hire a new developer at the time.

Anyways, during my time with them, I started working on a rework of their old puzzle game, Diceworks. This was released before the merge of two companies into the current Kyy Games. The game never caught the wind and the only version I saw of it was running in a web-player. The basic mechanic revolved around dices and matching them in a field. The project was halted because the artists in the company were fully occupied with more important projects, Like 'Cabals: Cabals: Magic & Battle Cards' and 'Knight of Pen & Paper 2'.

After this I was assigned into testing the recently released 'Trulon: The Shadown Engine' and some other minor testing. I also worked on a port of Windows game 'Cabals Legends'. This included updating of Google Game Services related plugins for Unity and other Unity plugins.

This was also my first glance into an actual Game House and just made my mind more clear on the fact that I wish to be a game developer.
