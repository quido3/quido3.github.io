## Why I am a good employee

I would be a good addition to any team, because I commit to the project. I like to see the thing I develop to the full fruitition. I am a independent worker, but like to work in a team. This means that I gladly take responsibility for a feature or a part of the project and apply myself to is to the full extent of my capabilities.

I like challenges, am quick to learn and like to try new things.
